                      The Licensed Work is (c) 2024-2025 AICUBE TECHNOLOGY LLC.
Additional Use Grant: You may make use of the Licensed Work, provided that you
                      do not use the Licensed Work for a Database Service.

                      A "Database Service" is a commercial offering that allows
                      third parties (other than your employees and contractors
                      acting on your behalf) to access the functionality of the
                      Licensed Work by creating tables, graphs, or executing
                      queries against the Licensed Work.

                      For the avoidance of doubt, the following uses are permitted:

                      1. Internal Use: You may use the Licensed Work for your
                         own internal business operations.

                      2. Development and Testing: You may use the Licensed Work
                         for development, testing, and evaluation purposes.

                      3. Non-Commercial Use: You may use the Licensed Work for
                         personal, educational, or non-commercial purposes.

                      4. Embedded Use: You may embed or integrate the Licensed
                         Work into your own applications, provided that you do
                         not offer the Licensed Work's database functionality
                         as a standalone service to third parties.
