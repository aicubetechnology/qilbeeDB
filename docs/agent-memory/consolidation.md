# Memory Consolidation

Memory consolidation in QilbeeDB mimics the human memory process of transferring information from short-term to long-term storage. This automatic process ensures that important experiences are preserved while maintaining system performance.

## Overview

Consolidation is the process of:
1. Identifying high-value short-term memories
2. Transferring them to long-term storage
3. Optimizing storage and indexing
4. Maintaining relationships and context

## How Consolidation Works

*This page is under development. Full documentation coming soon.*

For now, consolidation is managed automatically by QilbeeDB based on:
- Relevance scores above threshold
- Access frequency
- Age of episodes
- Configured consolidation intervals

- Review [Memory Statistics](statistics.md)
- Read [Agent Memory Overview](overview.md)
